Here you can submit an ASN (Advanced Shipping Notice) onto Pimento, this essentially allows the warehouse team to have notice of your shipment coming into the warehouse. Especially if you would like your shipment rushes when it arrives, we ask for as much notice as possible!

When you click into the ASN, it will show something similar to the below, the ‘Units Expected’ is what was submitted at the time of creating the ASN and ‘Units Processed’ is what the warehouse team counted when the shipment was being processed in. Any discrepancies will show a warning sign to alert you of the discrepancy. If anything arrives to us in an unsellable way, similar to returns the warehouse team will add a comment and attach any images so you have visibility of the condition of the stock.

It is good practice to add tracking information to an ASN and always keep the estimated time of arrival up to date using the edit button. This then keeps the warehouse team up to also!
