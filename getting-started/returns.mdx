The returns tab filters any expected, received or processed returns. You can click into each order and know what was expected in the order, the warehouse team can say what stock that actually received back and if it restocked into sellable or unsellable inventory. If for any reason the product can not be restocked then the warehouse team will add a comment on what the issue is and add images so brands can pass this onto the customer if they are enquiring for a refund.

There is also a ‘Actioned’ feature where brands can tick if the customer has been refunded or not to allow as much visibility as possible when looking at the returns tab. In Settings>Returns you can also add/choose which ‘Refund Methods’ you wish to offer your customer, this could be Store Credit or even Replacement.
