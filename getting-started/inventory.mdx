Here the inventory page will show all products (SKU’s) we have on Pimento with the stock levels attached.

### Stock

Using the **Stock** field search you can filter your search easier - especially if there are alot of products!

**In Stock:** This means the total number of units we have in the warehouse either in frontstock (stock is located in a picking bin where orders are picked from) or backstock (stock is located in a pallet location)

**Units Sold:** This shows the amount of units that have been ‘sold’ (reserved) for an order - for example if you have 20 units of Lipstick but 10 are in an order it would show as 10 units sold

**Units Available:** This indicates how many units are available to be added to new orders

**Out of Stock:** This feature was added to be able to clearly see what skus we do not have stock for, this is most commonly used for replenishing stock to the warehouse. Something that can also do this is ‘Inventory Out Forecast’ - the system uses the last 4 weeks of sales trends to predict how long the stock will last, ie 2 weeks or 3 months. Another option is to utilise the ‘Inventory Threshold’, this can be found within the information of a product. You can set this as a custom or use the Pimento default.

### Inventory Condition:

We ensure that clients have visibility of both sellable and unsellable stock - here you can toggle between both conditions.

### Deleted Skus (Hidden):

Sometimes as clients change up the products or as selected lines become discontinued there is the feature to delete products from the inventory page (these are just hidden so it keeps everything tidy) - You can always restore these skus/have visibility of them by using this field.

### Creating New Products:

You would just fill out the information shown below and hit submit, or alternatively you can bulk upload products. _Top Tip: Download the CSV file first and ensure the orders are in the correct format of the file so it uploads correctly to the system!_
