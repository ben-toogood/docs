title: Shipping Rules
---

These are created normally at the time of onboarding to ensure that orders from a sales channel pull through to Pimento and get dispatched on the correct shipping method.

In Shopify for example, the ‘Rate Name’ needs to get inputted into Pimento under ‘Copy’ as this is what matches them together. You can then filter to say if the shipping rule you are creating is for the UK and what shipping method you would like it to be dispatched onto.
