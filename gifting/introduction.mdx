The "Gifting" feature provides a streamlined way for brands to send products to multiple recipients simultaneously in bulk, all within a branded experience. By providing only a few pieces of key contact information (name & mobile number ), brands can initiate a branded experience via a gifting link sent to them vi that allows recipients to redeem their gift by filling in essential delivery information. This process culminates with the order being sent directly to the Pimento queue for the warehouse team to fulfil. This is ideal for managing influencer engagements, prize giveaways, and competitions.
