- Improving operational efficiency
- Enhancing security and compliance
- Tracking accountability

1. Operative - Operative users can pick, pack and ship orders, process stock, process returns and other warehouse floor tasks.
2. Supervisor - Can access most platform areas except billing and finance.
3. Manager - All unrestricted access to all areas of the platform, including billing and finance.
