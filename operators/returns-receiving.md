Are you fed up of clients emailing and asking if a customers return has been recieved? 

In the HutchOs app you can mark returns as recieved as they get delivered. This way your clients will always know what status their customers returns are in.

#### Steps for recieving a return:

1. Navigate to **Returns** > **Recieving** within the HutchOS app.

2. You can search for an order using order details such as, postcode, order number, customer name etc
3. Alternatively you can click the scan button on the top right to scan a barcode on the parcel to automatically populate the order details. This works on returned to sender parcel labels or aftercare supplied Royal Mail return labels.

5. On this page there are a set of options to complete. (Please note if the customer has chosen to return the order through aftercare, then these options will already be completed for you)

6. The **Reason*** drop down shows the below options. Choose the option most appropriate to the reason the parcel has been returned.

- If the customer returned of their own accord then you select either ‘customer initiated’ or ‘customer unhappy with product(s)’.
- If you select customer inititated and the client has set up return reasons in **settings > returns**, then you will proceed to another page to complete.

-  Requested refund method - Choose from Unspecified, Refund or Replacement

- Reason for retuning - reasons shown here are dictated by the return settings clients have set.

- If the order was returned by the courier as not delivered then choose why it was not delivered, perhaps an incorrect address.


7. **Customer paid shipping*** is an important part of processing the return. This directly relates to if the client will be charged for a return label charge or not. 

- **Yes** - Client will not be charged any label fee’s. This would normally mean that the customer personally paid to return the parcel and therefore no charge will be billed on the clients account.

- **No** -  Client will be charged the fee included in your rate card under returns > shipping fee.  Means that the customer did not pay for the return, ie it was either a returned order via the courier or perhaps they used an aftercare label provided.

8. **Dispatch date** - This is the date the return was dispatched. 

9. Click **Complete**, a pop up will show to advise the return has been marked as arrived.

10. This will now show on the HutchOS dashboard in Returns for your clients to see.

11. If your client has already enabled the Return - Recieved notification setting which can be found in **Settings** > **Notifications** then they will also recieve an email at this point to advise them a return has arrived at the warehouse.
