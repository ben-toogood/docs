Inventory Sync is a feature available for most integrations, allowing you to sync your stock levels on HutchOS to your store.

#### Configuration

There are three levels of inventory sync generally available:

1. **Daily**: Stock levels will sync daily overnight, this is perfect for brands who operate a single sales channel or are rarely go out of stock. This is available on most channels.

2. **Live**: Stock levels will sync immediately when they change on HutchOS. This is only available for a few channel integrations (notably Shopify). Whilst this can provide the most timely inventory sync, high-volume sellers can run into issue with Rate Limits _(where the store only allows a certain number of updates per hour or day)_. When this setting is enabled, a daily sync is also performed as per above.

3. **Disabled**: Stock levels will not be synced to this sales channel.

#### Bundles

Inventory Sync will also ensure bundle inventory is synced to your sales channel. For example, if you have 12 units of a TShirt SKU _(TS-001)_ and also sell it on your store as a three pack _(TS-001-X3)_, HutchOS will know to sync 12 units to your store for _TS-001_ and 4 units for _TS-001-X3_.

#### How to manage inventory sync

On the HutchOS dashboard, navigate to [Settings > Integrations](https://web.tryhutch.co.uk/clients/settings/integrations), and scroll down to the integration you would like to manage.

Within the card for this integration will be a toggle, which lets you switch between the different configurations. There is also a **Perform Sync Now** button on some sales chanels, which allows an immediate sync to take place in the background - this can take up to 15 minutes to complete.

If your store supports multiple warehouses (also known as Locations on some platforms), HutchOS will sync inventory to your default location.
