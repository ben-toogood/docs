To access this menu go to **Settings** > **Returns**.

1. What should we do with your damaged returns? You have 2 options: Keep them or Discard them.

2. Which return options should be available to your customers? There are 3 options:- Refund, Store Credit or Replacement. For example, if you only offer refunds to your customers when they are returning items then you would untick Store Credit and Replacement.

3. Which return reasons should your customers pick from? This option is really good if you want feedback from your customers. For example, if you were a clothing brand you may want to have options like 1. It is too big 2. It is too small 3. I donâ€™t like how it looks on me, etc. To add reasons just click the Add button > input reasons and click submit.
