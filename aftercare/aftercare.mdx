1. **Cancel Order (Shopify Only)** - Whilst orders are in the Processing or On Hold status, customers can cancel their order on Shopify. Please note, the refund will still need to be issued by the brand.
2. **Edit Address** - Whilst orders are in the Processing or On Hold status, customers can edit their address.
3. **Hold Orders** - Whilst orders are in the Processing or On Hold status, customers can request an order be paused and not dispatched. When the customer is ready for the order to be dispatched, they can release it and we'll dispatch the order.
4. **Freepost Returns (UK Only)** - Once an order is delivered, allow customers to generate a freepost Royal Mail return Label for UK orders.
5. **Return Window (Days)** - Once an order is delivered, how long do customers have to request a return? UK law requires 14 days as a minimum.
