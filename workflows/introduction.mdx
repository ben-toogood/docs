Workflows is a HutchOS feature that allows you to create an automatic workflow. Starting at a trigger point you can build up your workflow through a series of checks and actions.

- Do you need to add an insert into all your D2C (Direct to consumer) orders?

- Do you want to be able to send your customers a text message to advise them there order has been shipped?

- Do you want to send out a free gift to customers who order over a certain value?

- Do you want to send a handwritten note to a customer recieving a replacement order?

All of this is avilable through workflows, set it up once and leave it to work!
