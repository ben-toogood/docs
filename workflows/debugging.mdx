If you would like to check on your workflow, you can monitor its behaviour by going onto the workflow page and pressing on the **view runs** button to check, then the **view logs** button to see all the individual actions by the workflow.

The best way to use this is if you check what time an order was placed/came through to Pimento on the orders screen, you can then check here in the logs for the same time to see the communication between the order and the workflow.

You can also see on the timeline of an order if a workflow as changed or added something to an order.
